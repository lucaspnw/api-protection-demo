# api-protection-demo

This is a simple demo server for exercising API Protection. It will:

* respond to HTTP Requests with information about the request

* respond to DNS requests



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


Grab the package

```
git clone https://github.com/lucaspnw/api-protection-demo.git
```

Install the prerequisites

```
cd api-protection-demo
npm -i
```

Edit the configuration

```
vi package.json
```

Then run the server:

```
nodejs server.js
```

Then watch the logs

 

### Prerequisites

To use this, get a linux box that is routeable to your running API Protection system. Mac will probably also work but I didn't test it.
